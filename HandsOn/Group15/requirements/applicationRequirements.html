    <h1>Application Requirements</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>We have found datasets relevant to environmental monitoring in Barcelona: air quality, air pollutants, temperature, and trees.
      Our application is centered around environmental monitoring and visualization of this data.</p>

    <p>The primary use of our application will be to display a map which shows different climate information in the city of Barcelona.
      The map will be interactive and show information such as air quality in a visual way with color gradients. There will be different
      options to view the map with different information such as temperatures and air pollutants. The user will be able to choose a specific
      time period in order to investigate how this data has changed over time.</p>

    <p>Another feature for the application would be to overlay the trees recorded in one of the datasets. This would allow investigation of
      a potential correlation between the air metrics and trees in different areas of the city.</p>

    <h2>Mock-ups</h2>
    <p>The picture "temperature.png" shows the map in the temperature display mode.</p>


    <p>The user is able to select the mode, choosing the information to be displayed on the map. In this case, the mode is Temperature.</p>

    <p>The user is able to select the time period of the data using a calendar. In this case, the time period is March 2022.</p>

    <p>All recorded data points are visualized at the correct location and appear as colored dots on a gradient scale from dark red to light blue
      where dark red represents the highest temperatures and light blue represents the lightest temperatures.</p>

    <p>There is a search bar at the top of the map, allowing a user to search a location which the map will be centered around. The map is also
      interactive: the user can zoom in and out with gestures.</p>



    <p>To contrast this screen with different selections, the picture "contamination.png" shows the map on the Air contamination section for the year 2006 in a
      different region of Barcelona.</p>
