# Analysis
# Ontology
- The ontology does not follow the resource naming strategy defined in the analysis.
- It is a good practice to name properties using verbs. For example, now you have "ParkingSpace" and "parkingSpace" in your ontology, which refer to different things.
- You have to review the modelling of the ontology, since it leads to problems in the RDF data.
# RDF data
- The RDF file does not follow the resource naming strategy.
- Some datatypes are not correct.
- Some parking occupancies cover different months.
- Some parking spaces cover different levels and dates.
- Some price specifications cover multiple prices.
- Trim strings before adding them to the RDF.
# Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
