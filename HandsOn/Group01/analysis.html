    <h1>Waste Collection Dataset Analysis</h1>
    <h3>Residuos_2021_2023.csv</h3>
    <p><i>The dataset contains 5527 rows and 7 columns, with 0 missing values.</i></p>
    <p>We merged the three datasets of waste collection from 2021 to 2023 in a single csv file. We also translated each feature and each value in English. We could see that there were problems in visualizing the district names correctly due to the encoding
        of the accents. To solve this, we changed each unique district name using Python.</p>
