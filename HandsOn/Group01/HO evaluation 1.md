# Analysis
- The analysis.html file does not contain the license of the dataset to be generated.
# Ontology
- You don't need to define rdfs:label in your ontology.
# RDF data
- rdfs:label "District_1" is not a proper label for the district. It should be the name.
- URIs are encoded as strings.
- Don't give string values to month. Give numeric values so they are more useful.
- There is no way of knowing, for a district, how many residues of each type there are.
# Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
