1.-Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed.

2.-Install the yarrrml-parser, which translates YARRRML rules to RML rules.
    npm i @rmlio/yarrrml-parser -g

3.-Make sure you have a recent version of Java installed.

4.-Make sure you have a recent version of the RMLMapper. (https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java)
    You can either download a release or build it from source.

5.- Write your YARRRML rules. For example, in the document called rules.yml.

6.-Translate the YARRRML rules and execute the RMLMapper with the corresponding RML rules.

    yarrrml-parser -i rules.yml -o rules.rml.ttl
    java -jar /path/to/rmlmapper.jar -m rules.rml.ttl

[The generated RDF triples and quads are directed to standard output,
but you can send them to a file by using the option -o /path/to/outputfile of the RMLMapper.]
