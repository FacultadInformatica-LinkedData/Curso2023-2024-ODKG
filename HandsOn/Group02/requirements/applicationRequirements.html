    <h1>Requirements for Developing the SmartMadrid+ App Interface</h1>
    <p>This HTML document outlines the selected requirements for the development of the graphical user interface (GUI) to create the SmartMadrid+ application.</p>

    <p>The goal of the application is to provide users with a new way to connect to the internet through free Wi-Fi hotspots distributed across the municipality. By doing so, users can access cultural points of interest, such as study rooms and museums, and it also aids seniors in discovering communication-friendly centers.</p>

    <h2>R1. Map and Search Box</h2>
    <p>The application must allow users to visualize a map and a search box.</p>

    <h2>R2. Location Input</h2>
    <p>The search box should enable users to enter a location, and upon submission, the map should automatically center on that location, displaying nearby Wi-Fi hotspots.</p>

    <h2>R3. Information Display</h2>
    <p>For each nearby Wi-Fi hotspot, the application should present information about the center in a standardized format across all centers.</p>
