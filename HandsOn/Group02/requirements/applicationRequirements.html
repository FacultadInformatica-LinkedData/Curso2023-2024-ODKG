# Application requirements 

We have found datasets relevant to environmental monitoring in Barcelona: air quality, air pollutants, temperature and trees. Our application is centered around environmental monitoring and visualization of this data.

The primary use of our app will be to display a map which shows different climate information in the city of Barcelona. The map will be interactive and show information such as air quality in a visual way with colour gradients. There will be different options to view the map through different lenses such as temperatures and air pollutants. The user will be able to choose a specific time period in order to investigate how this data has changed over time. 

Another feature for the application would be to overlay the trees recorded in one of the datasets. This would allow investigation of a potential correlation between the air metrics and trees in different areas of the city.
