Application requirements 

Overview

We have found datasets relevant to environmental monitoring in Barcelona: air quality, air pollutants, temperature and trees. Our application is centred around environmental monitoring and visualisation of this data.

The primary use of our application will be to display a map which shows different climate information in the city of Barcelona. The map will be interactive and show information such as air quality in a visual way with colour gradients. There will be different options to view the map with different information such as temperatures and air pollutants. The user will be able to choose a specific time period in order to investigate how this data has changed over time. 

Another feature for the application would be to overlay the trees recorded in one of the datasets. This would allow investigation of a potential correlation between the air metrics and trees in different areas of the city.


Mock-ups

The following screen shows the map in the temperature display mode
The user is able to select the mode, choosing the information to be displayed on the map. In this case, the mode is Temperature
The user is able to select the time period of the data using a calendar. In this case, the time period is March 2022. 
All recorded data points are visualised at the correct location and appear as coloured dots on a gradient scale from dark red to light blue where dark red represents the highest temperatures and light blue represents the lightest temperatures.
There is a search bar at the top of the map, allowing a user to search a location which the map will be centred around. The map is also interactive: the user can zoom in and out with gestures.



To contrast this screen with different selections, the next screen shows the map on the Air contamination section for the year 2006 in a different region of Barcelona.
