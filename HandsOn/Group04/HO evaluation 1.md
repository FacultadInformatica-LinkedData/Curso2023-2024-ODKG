# Analysis
# Ontology
- You don't need the Concept class unless you add more information about these concepts. If not, you are creating many resources for the same concept.
- Something similar happens with the Audience class.
# RDF data
- The range of price is defined as boolean in the ontology but in the RDF data it has non-boolean values.
# Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
