# Analysis
# Ontology
- URIs in the prefixes contain spaces.
- The triples with the ontology metadata are not correct.
- The ontology presents serialization issues; is not a valid Turtle file. Do not edit ontology files by hand.
- xsd:real does not exist.
# RDF data
- Latitudes and longitudes are not properly encoded. Furthermore, they present values following different representations.
# Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
