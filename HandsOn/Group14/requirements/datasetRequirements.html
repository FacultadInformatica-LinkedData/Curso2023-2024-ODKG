    <h1>Datasets and Requirements</h1>

    <h2>R1: Data are in the smart cities domain</h2>
    <p>We have selected data regarding air quality and temperatures in the city of Barcelona. This data is useful in the smart cities domain because
      it can be used to track and monitor the effects of pollution and infrastructure. Ultimately, this can be used to improve building planning and
      to implement strategies to mitigate climate change and overpopulation.</p>

    <h2>R2. Data are available as a CSV file</h2>
    <p>We have uploaded the selected datasets in the csv directory. We sourced the data from free CSV downloads on the open data website for Barcelona.</p>

    <h2>R3. Data have an open license so it can be published</h2>
    <p>All of the datasets we are using are under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. This license allows us to share and remix the content freely,
      even for commercial purposes. The only restriction is attribution: giving appropriate credit and indicating if any changes are made.</p>

    <h2>R4. Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities (e.g., locations).</h2>
    <p>The data we have chosen is easily linkable. There is data regarding time and location (including latitude, longitude, and neighborhood) of
      the measurements, allowing us to link the data with any other data or measurements from the same places. One of the descriptions of the dataset
      suggests using the data with road data also available on the Barcelona open data website.</p>

    <h2>R5. Documentation exists for the data (optional).</h2>
    <p>We have somewhat satisfied this requirement: there is not in-depth documentation but there is some light documentation for the data, describing
      the context, origin, and purpose of the data. The data itself is quite well-structured and self-descriptive. There are frequently-asked questions
      documents online which describe the definitions of terms and how they can be used. An example of this is
      <a href="https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/mapes-dades-ambientals/qualitataire/en/faqs.html">

    <h2>R6. Data can come from multiple data sources (optional).</h2>
    <p>Yes, we have satisfied this requirement. We have selected a variety of datasets about air quality and temperatures, data from multiple data sources.
      All of this data is provided on the open data website of Barcelona.</p>
