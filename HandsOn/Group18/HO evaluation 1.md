# Analysis
- The resource naming strategy for the ontology terms must not be only a domain name.
- The resource naming strategy should use different paths for ontology resources and individuals.
# Ontology
- The domain and/or range of some property is not defined.
- Some classes are used in property definitions but are not declared.
# RDF data
- All the accidents have the same num_Expediente; I don't know if this is correct.
- Accidents have multiple values for some properties. It does not seem correct (e.g., the accident taking place in multiple locations).
- Boolean data values are not encoded properly.
- Solve the character encoding issues.
- Individuals have no type.
- Some entities could be encoded as strings and not instances.
- Not every string composed by numbers is a number.
# Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
