            <p> This dataset provides all Post Secondary Education facilities such as Doctoral/Research Universities,
                Masters Colleges and Universities, Baccalaureate Colleges and more.</p>
            <p> This dataset contains 6559 instances with the variables chosen for our dataset being:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>IPEDSID (PK):</strong> The dataset includes the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data
                    System's
                    ID number making it possible to easily merge them with our other datasets.
                    As key, there are no missing values and 6474 unique values. </li>
                <li><strong>Name (String):</strong> This column provides the names of the universities. There are 6349

                    There are 12 missing values and 6394 unique values since some adresses have the name
                    of the campus where more than one institution can be located.</li>
                <li><strong>Latitude (Float) :</strong> This column provides the latitude coordinate of the location of
                    the
                    institution.Since this dataset contains primarly north american institutions,
                    the most common values are found in the interval [24,49] having a 97% of apperance in the dataset.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Longitud (Float) :</strong> This column provides the longitud coordinate of the location of
                    the
                    institution. As well as the latitide, in the [-130,-60] interval you can find
                    99% of the values. </li>
                <li><strong>City (String) :</strong> This column provides the name of the city where the institution is
                    located. There are 2351 unique cities where these institutions are located. </li>

            </p>
            <p> This dataset provides the rankings for the top 150 US universities and top 250 colleges since 1983.</p>
            <p> This dataset contains 528 instances with some of the data being incomplete, specially in the earlier
                years.
                The variables chosen for our dataset are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IPEDSID (PK):</strong> As mentioned before, this column contains the ID Number to merge with
                    the
                    other datasets. There are no missing values and each value is unique.</li>
                <li><strong>Years(String):</strong> There are 38 different columns, with their name being the year in
                    which
                    the ranking was made, containing the positions in which the university or
                    college ended up. This column is a string instead of an integer because for the college rankings,
                    the
                    colleges ranked below 100, depending of the year, are ranked in intervals such as
                    "T3 (81-120)" or "T4 (121-160)". The most recent years don't have almost any missing values but, for
                    example, in the universities ranking, before 1996, there are a 85% of missing values.</li>

        The DBCL 1.0 is a license designed specifically for databases, focusing on the protection of the 
        contents within a database rather than the structure of the database itself. It permits users to freely use, modify, and distribute 
        the database contents while imposing certain conditions, such as attributing the source of the data. Unlike the CC0 license, which places a work 
        in the public domain, the DBCL 1.0 maintains some restrictions to ensure proper attribution and integrity of the database contents. It strikes a balance 
        between openness and the requirement to acknowledge the source of the data when used in derivative works. Because of DBCL 1.0 is th emore restrictive, 
        we select it for our dataset.

        <h1>Resource Naming Strategy</h1>

        <p>
            In our ontology we have defined the base URI as <span
                style="font-family: monospace;">http://www.semanticweb.org/upm/opendata/group08/</span>.
            We use hash for the classes properties and slash for the instances.
            <ul>
            <li>The uri for classes and properties is <span style="font-family: monospace;">http://www.semanticweb.org/upm/opendata/group08/ontology/UniversityInformation#</span></li>
            <li>The uri for resources(instances) is <span style="font-family: monospace;">http://www.semanticweb.org/upm/opendata/group08/resource/</span></li>
            </ul>
            Also, we use different prefixes such as <span style="font-family: monospace;">dbo</span> or <span
                style="font-family: monospace;">schema</span>. This allows us
            to have a clearer overview of the ontology resources.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, we have used labels and named the properties in a descriptive way to increase the ontology
            readability.
