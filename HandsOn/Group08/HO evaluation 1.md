# Analysis
- The resource naming strategy lacks examples and is the opposite of what you are applying in practice.
# Ontology
- The ontology presents serialization issues; is not a valid Turtle file. Do not create ontologies by hand; use some tool.
- Review the datatypes used; not all of them are literals.
# RDF data
- Datatypes are incorrect.
- The resource naming strategy should use different paths for ontology resources and individuals.
- Universities have multiple admission rates.
- Individuals have no type.
- Verify that the class and property names used in the RDF data are the same as those used in the ontology.
# Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
