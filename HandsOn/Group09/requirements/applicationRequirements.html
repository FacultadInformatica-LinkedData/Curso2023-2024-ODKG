    <h1>Requirements for the Bike Sharing Application</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The application will allow the user to analyze bike sharing data to determine the stages of highest and lowest bike usage in order to predict additional bike needs or relocation.</p>

    <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Administrator Login:
            <ul>
                <li>The administrator should be able to log in to the application with valid credentials.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Data Visualization:
            <ul>
                <li>Once authenticated, the administrator will be able to view charts and tables representing bike usage in the city.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bike usage forecasting:
            <ul>
                <li>The application should provide a forecasting function that suggests when more bikes may be needed at a specific stage and when bikes from less-used stages could be relocated.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>User Interface Mock-ups</h2>
    <p>Below are some examples of what the user interface of the application could look like:</p>
