# Analysis
- Very good.
# Ontology
- The ontology presents serialization issues; is not a valid Turtle file. Do not create ontologies by hand.
- It is a good practice to name properties using verbs. For example, now you have "City" and "city" in your ontology, which refer to different things.
# RDF data
- Datatypes are missing.
- Not every string composed by numbers is a number.
# Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
