# Analysis
- The resource naming strategy is not fully described.
# Ontology
- I don't know if "Peaton" is the proper name to describe that class.
# RDF data
- The individuals of Peaton are mixing information from different individuals.
- Trim strings before adding them to the RDF.
- The RDF file does not follow the resource naming strategy. Classes in the RDF data are not named in the same way as classes in the ontology.
# Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
