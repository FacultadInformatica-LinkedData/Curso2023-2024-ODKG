# Analysis
# Ontology
- In OWL, having multiple domains (or ranges) means that the domain (or range) is the intersection of all the classes.  The current definitions of properties with multiple domains are wrong.
- Domains are missing in datatype properties.
# RDF data
- The class Neighbourhood is called Neighbourhood1 in the RDF data.
# Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
