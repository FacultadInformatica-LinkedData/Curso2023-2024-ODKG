## Comments on the self-assessment

We adopted a sequential approach in which each member of the group makes some reasonable changes on the dataset, loads the updated CSV file and accordingly the operations in a JSON file, following the naming convention `openrefine/<operation-order>-<github-user>.json`. Then another user makes its changes on the previously updated version and so on.
