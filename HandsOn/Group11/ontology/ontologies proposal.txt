We propose the following ontologies for the classes:

ArtDimension:
https://www.w3.org/2019/wot/hypermedia#object-properties 
where we can find the properties like:
hasSizes, that follows the pattern {Height}x{Width} that would correspond to the properties hasWidth and hasHeight
What is more we propose the following ontology: https://schema.org/VisualArtwork
where all the properties would be covered (Width, Height, Description)

Artist:
https://d-nb.info/standards/elementset/gnd#NameOfThePerson
property covered is ArtistName
