    <h1>Dataset Requirements - Group 02</h1>
    
    <p>Requirement 1 -> Data are in the smart cities domain: 
        We believe that the dataset we have chosen satisfies this requirement because 
        we are working with data from the Madrid City Council.
        
    </p>
    <p>Requirement 2 -> Data are available as a CSV file: 
        We believe that the dataset we have selected satisfies this requirement because 
        we have downloaded the dataset in CSV format.
    </p>
    <p>Requirement 3 -> Data have an open license so it can be published: 
        All datasets operate under the open license at the following link:
        <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.3efdb29b813ad8241e830cc2a8a409a0/?vgnextoid=108804d4aab90410VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=b4c412b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default">License Information</a>
    </p>
    <p>Requirement 4 -> Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities (e.g., locations): 
        The dataset on Cultural events can be linked to The dataset of Cultural centers where those events may take place. 
        We can link both dataset to locations (districts, streets), cultural center webpages and organizers/participants identifiers if needed as well. 
    </p>
    <p>Requirement 5 -> Documentation exists for the data:
        The dataset is well documented in a pdf file detailing its structure and columns.
        Documentation for the Data Catalog: <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/FWProjects/egob/Catalogo/XComun/Ficheros/Estructura_DS_ConjuntoDatos.pdf">Madrid Data Catalog Documentation</a>
        Documentation for Cultural events datasets: <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/sites/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=6c0b6d01df986410VgnVCM2000000c205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=374512b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD">Dataset Documentation</a>
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>Requirement 6 -> Data can come from multiple data sources:
        We are considering datasets for both the cultural activities agenda as well as the cultural centers available in the city.
